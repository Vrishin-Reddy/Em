# Squid Project

A visually stunning 3D experience using **Three.js** and **GLTF models**, inspired by Squid Game. This project renders a dynamic 3D environment in the browser, showcasing animations and detailed 3D models with seamless interactivity.

---

## Features
- 3D model rendering with GLTF.
- Smooth animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
- Lightweight and efficient rendering with Three.js.
- Organized and clean code structure for scalability.
- Realistic textures and materials for an immersive experience.
